## Abstract

This OBIP describes the design of a 'classified'. Classifieds enabled a user can create a type of listing that can be used as a non-purchasable ad, where settlment of the listing takes place outside of OpenBazaar's internal wallet.  

## Motivation

OpenBazaar currently assumes all settlement will take place using Bitcoin via its internal wallet. However, many users may wish to take advantage of OpenBazaar's growing user-base, hosting & listing infrastructure to advertise their goods and services, but settle the transaction with buyers outside of Bitcoin.

## Requirements

Classifieds enable the user to create a new listing type in addition to physical goods, digital goods, and services. This listing type cannot be purchased within OpenBazaar, but allows for all of listing functionality.

## Specification

The specification calls for a change to `contracts.pb`, where a new `ContractType` is enumberated: `CLASSIFIED`.

```
enum ContractType {
    PHYSICAL_GOOD = 0;
    DIGITAL_GOOD  = 1;
    SERVICE       = 2;
    CROWD_FUND    = 3;
    CLASSIFIED    = 4;
}
```

All nodes must reject purchases of a 'classified' listing type.

## Rationale

*Advantages*

- Extends the functionality of OpenBazaar
- Allows vendors who are not into Bitcoin to list on a decentralised marketplace, and can serve as a gateway to draw these people into cryptocurrency

*Disadvantages*

- Search indexes will need to filter-out classifieds from physical, digital, and service listing types
- Dedicated interface required for viewing classifieds that needs careful thought to avoid confusion for users

## Backwards Compatibility

Non-upgraded nodes will not be able to create a classified. Since classifieds cannot be purchased, no major compatibility issues should exist.
