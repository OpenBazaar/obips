## Abstract
A specification for a system allowing 3rd parties to provide a list of moderators that it has verified in some way, with the nature and extent of the verifications being defined by the 3rd party itself.

## Motivation
Allow buyers on OpenBazaar to have more information about the identity and reputation of moderators for given listings. If a 3rd party can provide accurate verifications of the moderator's identity, knowledge, fairness, and/or reliability then users can make safer decisions.

## Verified Moderators Endpoint

To provide verified moderators a provider must have a public endpoint returning data with the exact schema provided below. All fields are required and at least 1 type and 1 moderator is required. There is no standard length requirements on fields but clients may pad or truncate displayed fields as needed.

#### Badge Images

Badge images should be provided as a few standard sized icons with a square aspect ratio for best display results:

```
tiny: 60px
small: 120px
medium: 240px
large: 480px
```
