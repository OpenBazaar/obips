## Abstract
A specification for a system allowing 3rd parties to provide a list of moderators that it has verified in some way, with the nature and extent of the verifications being defined by the 3rd party itself.

## Motivation
Allow buyers on OpenBazaar to have more information about the identity and reputation of moderators for given listings. If a 3rd party can provide accurate verifications of the moderator's identity, knowledge, fairness, and/or reliability then users can make safer decisions.

## Verified Moderators Endpoint

To provide verified moderators a provider must have a public endpoint returning data with the following schema:

#### Example

```json
GET https://bazaarco.example.com/verified_moderators

{
  "data": {
    "name": "BazaarCo",
    "description": "Moderators verified by BazaarCo",
    "link": "https://bazaarco.example.com/verifications"
  },
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "standard",
      "description": "A moderator that has been vetted by BazaarCo",
      "badge": "https://bazaarco.example.com/standard_badge.png"
    },
    {
      "name": "small_bonded",
      "description": "A moderator that has bonded $1000 with BazaarCo",
      "badge": "https://bazaarco.example.com/small_bonded_badge.png"
    }
  ],
  "moderators": [
    {
      "peerID": "QmXFMkpBBpL4zcYAArVAecLyypFrRzp2Co4q9oXUtzF7XF",
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "peerID": "QmVFNEj1rv2d3ZqSwhQZW2KT4zsext4cAMsTZRt5dAQqFJ",
      "type": "small_bonded"
    }
  ]
}
```
