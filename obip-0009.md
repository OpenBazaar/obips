## Abstract
This obip defines a new data sharing protocol using IPFS pubsub to ensure persistent of content when users are offline.

## Motivation
In basic IPFS content only persists when users go offline if other users have viewed/downloaded the content and those users remain online. Thus IPFS provides no hard garanutees that OpenBazaar stores will remain available when a user goes offline. Currently the protocol tries to remedy this problem by defining a list of "data peers" in the config file and
by pushing content to them on each publish to ensure persistence. The downside to this approach is the sharing of data is limited only to those peers found in the config file. While users remain free to change the default list of data peers, in practice very few do which elevates the default peers to the status of critcal infrastructure. 

By creating a pubsub channel for user content anyone on the network is free to subscribe to the channel and receive updates to all new content published on the network. They are then free to sort through that content and decide what they want to re-seed.

## Specification
